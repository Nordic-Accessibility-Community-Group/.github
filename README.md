# Nordic Accessibility Community Group
This organisation is a part of the W3C Community Group.

Initiative started from the discussion about having the same view of what is included and how to test the EN-standard and WCAG. [Meeting notes from 2024-11-07](https://www.w3.org/community/nordic-accessibility/2024/11/07/en-301-549-vs-wcag-gaps-and-bridges-study-group/)
